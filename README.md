A self-managed mobile queuing system - spend your waiting time productively.

1. A vendor starts a queue, obtains a QR code and puts it on display
2. Customers come and scan the QR code, get in the virtual line and go about their business
3. When someone's turn comes, they get an alert

Optionally, customers in line can trade places with someone else for a negotiated charge. Free market enters the queue!
